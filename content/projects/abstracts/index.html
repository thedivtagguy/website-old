            Course abstracts in design schools have a way of saying things without
            telling you what they mean. I am all for the use of good language and
            metaphors, but I sometimes don't quite know what to make of paragraphs
            that {{< sidenote "left" "left-note" "go like this" >}} Any resemblance to
            anything at all is *coughs* purely coincidental. {{< /sidenote >}}:
            <br /><br />
            <span class="block max-w-6xl py-4 -mt-2 text-base italic text-gray-700">The cloud is a structure woven into air that we breathe. It makes
                intersections where there are none and brings into connection disparate
                objects; a branch, a roof, leaf, a pole, scooter and soil. And all this
                ceases to exist as the wind blows. This studio looks at impermanence and
                the various forms it takes.</span>
            What does it mean? What will I do for the next one month? Who knows?

            Ambiguity is the name of the game, and I believe the power to be
            ambiguious should reside with the people. I demand to be ambiguious about
            things that
            <em>I</em> care about too. Ambiguity is not a resource of the bourgeoisie.
            The proletariat should seize the means of ambiguity. I proclaim Liberté,
            égalité, ambiguïté.<br>

            If clouds were good enough, then if I felt like attending a class about
            cauliflowers, I should be able to. Same goes for bubbles. Or moustaches.

            So I trained an AI model using GPT-3, one of the most sophisticated
            text-generation models available right now, to generate a course abstract
            for anything I wanted. Here are the results.

        <p class="text-sm">The text for this experiment was generated using the DaVinci text generation model by the Open AI Foundation.
            The model was trained on a set of course abstracts found in my email and from other sources (wink wink). The only instructions given to the model were:</p>
        <p class="py-4 text-sm italic">
            Write a SUMMARY for EACH TOPIC. Each summary must be BRIEF, FUNNY, SATIRICAL and VERBOSE.<br>

            Topic: Imagination<br>
            Summary: Imagination and creativity are the basic components of the artist/designers toolbox and yet they are so intangible and hard to pin down. Whether it is thinking about the future ordinating for research, this studio explores multiple media to open up what is possible, to speculate and imagine. What could the future look like ? - Is the answer in the realms of art, design, code or science fiction?<br>
            ###<br>

        <p class="text-sm">
            The model was then given random words and the output saved.
