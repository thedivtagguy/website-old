      A friend of mine uses my phone nearly twice a day to place an order on Swiggy because mine is the only one on our floor which has a ‘Swiggy Binge’ plan, which offers free delivery. After the order is placed, Swiggy reminds me of the progress periodically and lets me know that the order is being prepared, the delivery partner is at the restaurant, that he has left and he’s nearly arrived. 
      
      The process seemed new and exciting to me two years ago, when I would watch the bright, purposeful icon on a nicely coloured, empty map zoom around my city. It almost felt like a game, where I had to scour the app for the highest rated restaurants, find the discounted items, try to club them with the best coupons and with a few taps I could summon this little man on the map to bring me food.

         <p>Labour laws are an important part of any employee-employer relationship.

      <p class="py-8 text-base lg:text-xl">
         Before the pandemic, both platforms had so-called ‘Hub Managers’ that handled certain zones and would overlook the functioning of delivery partners and register any complaints or problems they may have. That has since been replaced by a ticketing system on their apps. Any problems they might have, such as falling sick, meeting with an accident or getting held up by thieves at night, are routed through this system. While this achieves cuts in staff that the platforms want, there is a trade-off in the efficiency and quality of redressal. 
         
         By asking partners to only report incidents through the app, there is already a divide between those who can read and write and those who can’t, as well as those who know how to use this system and those who don’t. This does not always guarantee a reasonable solution to their problem, which may be more varied than what a few options that a chatbot might present.

      <h4 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center font-blacker">Fluctuating Pay</h4>
      <p class="py-8 text-base lg:text-xl">
         Swiggy and Zomato advertisements claim that a delivery partner can earn between Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 40,000 a month because no limit on the number of deliveries present the potential to earn an amount that is competitive with entry level jobs in the formal sector. These figures are not a general average and don’t take into account the fuel, maintenance and personal costs that partners bear while on duty. There is no set minimum base pay for a single day, which means any leave can lose you a significant portion of earnings. 

         Orders may also not necessarily be assigned equitably; In our survey, partners recounted how they seemed relatively free as compared to the other delivery executives in the same area. A partner may be logged into the platform for 8-10 hours but only get 5-10 deliveries during that time.

      <h4 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center font-blacker">Arbitrary Penalties</h4>
      <p class="py-8 text-base lg:text-xl">
         Workers are at the mercy of the algorithm when it comes to facing penalties. There are no fixed guidelines to decide exactly when the worker is accountable and for what. For instance when any damage or spillage occurs due to poor packaging, the worker informs the customer care executive who in turn informs the customer about the matter and cancels the order. However, Swiggy penalises the worker for not delivering the order and not the restaurant for their mishandling. Another worker we interacted with recounted how his account was suspended from a platform because he took a sick leave for four days. A series of bad customer reviews can lead to an account suspension and wipe out earnings for days or even weeks. Such incidents leave many workers unaware about the reason behind the consequences that they might face and the circumstances under which they will face it. Since there is no way to contest a decision, the person is forced to move to a different platform.

    <div class="w-2/5 mx-auto">
      <img src="/gigs/cycle.png">
   </div>
   <p class="py-8 text-base lg:text-xl">

         Both platforms also have certain ‘levels’ that they assign each delivery partner depending on whether they drive a motorcycle or a bicycle, which gives them access to farther or nearer orders (therefore affecting earnings). As penalties, they may be downgraded to a different level as well, even if they’re still working the same distances.

The problem lies in the fact that flexible working hours come with the opportunity cost of not earning enough money. Since the pay is variable and dependent on the number of hours they work for and the number of orders they complete in a day, the workers often end up pushing themselves to work for more hours than they desire to in order to earn enough money for their survival. There is no guaranteed minimum pay offered to them.  

We collected data on delivery workers from different platforms to look at how many deliveries they do and what they earn. Let's see what that looks like.

We surveyed 50 delivery workers from Swiggy and Zomato and asked them what their daily earnings, number of deliveries, average pay and time spent on each order was. This data was analysed and we trained a model by using these parameters to see if we could ‘generate’ our own deliveries for any number of days and see how much we could earn during that time. 

Now it’s your turn, how about you give food delivery a go? The results of our analysis has been turned into a short interactive experience which will allow you to see how much you can earn doing deliveries. Give it a go and see how you do!
